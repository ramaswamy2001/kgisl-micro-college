                    <p>I can create websites that not only look fantastic but also work perfectly because to my skill in front-end programming. I have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other crucial front-end technologies, and I always work to expand my knowledge to be on the cutting edge of the field.</p>

                    <h1 className="">Graphic Designer</h1>
                    <p>As a graphic designer, I bring to my work a great eye for aesthetics and a thorough understanding of branding. I think effective communication and forging an emotional bond with consumers are equally essential components of successful design, in addition to having things seem nice.</p>
